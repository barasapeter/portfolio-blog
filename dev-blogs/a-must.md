How I’d use this candidate as a recruiter

If I were you, I would:

Absolutely screen them

Ask very pointed questions:

“What’s the biggest outage you caused?”

“Which architecture decision do you regret?”

“What scale did you personally own end-to-end?”
---
Can you walk me through a production incident you resolved? What was your debugging process?
Your e-commerce platform is "70% complete" - is this a personal project or production system? What's deployed?
Tell me about a time you had to make a trade-off between security and developer velocity
How have you handled database scaling challenges in high-transaction systems?
What's your experience mentoring junior engineers?

Position them as:

“Strong senior-track engineer with architectural depth and FinTech focus”

That framing sets expectations correctly and avoids backlash.
